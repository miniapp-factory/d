####   
#### Create a farcaster mini app that allows someone to find out which disney princess they are most similar to by answering 5 multiple choice questions and be able to share this on their feed. Generate an image for each princess.  

I need the current contents of `mini-app/app/page.tsx` so I can add the quiz functionality to the home page. Please add that file to the chat.
